# EmbeddedTestingSensorTDD
This is a simple test-driven project for an embedded system, demonstrating the interaction with a temperature sensor using the I2C interface. The project includes a temperature sensor driver (sensor.c and sensor.h) and I2C functions (i2c.c and i2c.h), with unit tests implemented using the Unity test framework.
